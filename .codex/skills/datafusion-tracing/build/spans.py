"""Derive the emitted span contract from upstream's pinned trace snapshots.

The question an agent has about this library is almost never "does this function exist". It is
"what will I see in Jaeger" -- span names, levels, targets, field names, nesting. No signature
carries any of that, and the crate's own metrics field names are built as

    format!("datafusion.metrics.{}", metric.value().name())

from whichever DataFusion node happened to run, so the field vocabulary is OPEN. It cannot be
enumerated from the source at all. It can only be observed.

Upstream observes it for us. `tests/snapshots/*_trace.snap` are insta captures of the JSON span
stream under nine scenarios whose option sets are declared in `tests/integration_tests.rs`, and
those nine scenarios differ from each other one option at a time. That makes the corpus a
natural experiment: a field that appears in exactly the scenarios carrying
`with_metrics_collection()` is conditional on metrics, and the table can say so rather than
listing every field as if it were unconditional.

These rows are `recorded`, never `confirmed`. They are upstream's observations under upstream's
harness; assertion-level probe receipts are separate evidence and never promote an aggregate row.

One snapshot is not valid JSON. See `REPAIR` below -- the cause is exact, upstream's own, and
quotable, so the repair is a named substitution rather than a heuristic, and every row derived
from that file is flagged.
