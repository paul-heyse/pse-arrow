"""Turn the twelve `macro_rules!` macros into a table of accepted invocation forms.

Twelve of the fifteen items this crate publishes are macros, so the API a caller writes is
invocation grammar, not signatures. rustdoc elides a macro's body -- every arm reads
`=> { ... }` -- but it keeps the arms themselves, and the arms ARE the grammar:

    (target: $target:expr, options: $options:expr, $($field:tt)*) => { ... };
    (options: $options:expr, $($field:tt)*) => { ... };
    (target: $target:expr, options: $options:expr) => { ... };
    (options: $options:expr) => { ... };

Nothing else in the repository carries this. `options:` is a mandatory keyword, not a positional
argument; `target:` is optional and changes what a subscriber filter must match; and the
trailing `$($field:tt)*` is where the `field = field::Empty` declarations go, without which
`add_custom_field` sets a value that reaches no span. Getting any of those wrong is a macro
expansion error whose message names none of them.

What this module cannot tell you is what an arm expands to. See `reference.md` limit 5: rustdoc
emits no macro bodies at any format version, so the expansion is established by the source
corpus and by probes, never by the index.
