A procedural macro attribute for instrumenting functions with [`tracing`].

[`tracing`] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
structured, event-based diagnostic information. This crate provides the
[`#[instrument]`][instrument] procedural macro attribute.

Note that this macro is also re-exported by the main `tracing` crate.

*Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.65+][msrv]*

[msrv]: #supported-rust-versions

## Usage

In the `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tracing-attributes = "0.1.24"
```

The [`#[instrument]`][instrument] attribute can now be added to a function
to automatically create and enter `tracing` [span] when that function is
called. For example:

```
use tracing::instrument;

#[instrument]
pub fn my_function(my_arg: usize) {
    // ...
}

# fn main() {}
```

[`tracing`]: https://crates.io/crates/tracing
[span]: https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/span/index.html
[instrument]: macro@self::instrument

## Supported Rust Versions

Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
version is 1.65. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on
Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio
project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor
versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current
stable compiler version is 1.69, the minimum supported version will not be
increased past 1.66, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum
supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as
long as doing so complies with this policy.
