# Design review — reference

Companion to [SKILL.md](SKILL.md). Lenses and calibration examples that have repeatedly
turned up real defects. None is a required step. Principle IDs refer to the core design
principles; profile lenses live in the profile's own skill. Examples below are illustrative
calibration cases, not findings about the repository being reviewed.

## §1 Lenses

### Architecture before mechanisms

Reconstruct the responsibilities and consequential dependency paths. Then trace a small set
of changes capable of distinguishing the alternatives. A public interface alone does not
establish a boundary: follow its inputs, outputs, required initialization and consumers.

| Shape | Evidence that makes it reportable | Foundation |
|---|---|---|
| Several independent reasons to change in one owner | Two concrete changes to unrelated policies/representations require editing the same orchestration internals; identify the responsibilities mixed | AP-01 |
| Implementation mechanics exposed as the contract | A consumer must inspect backend objects or know initialization order to perform a semantic operation; trace the replacement change into that consumer | AP-02 |
| Workflow duplication | An ordinary new workflow repeats preparation, capability policy or failure translation instead of composing owners; show the repeated decision | AP-03/AP-04 |
| Implicit lifecycle | A valid call depends on unrelated prior registration or ambient state not expressed by construction or contract | AP-05/AP-06 |
| Unnecessary test infrastructure | A pure policy/resolution test must initialize storage or a solver because its constructor reaches a broad runtime object; trace the dependency, not merely the import | AP-06 |
| Excessive integration machinery | A proposed adapter brings configuration, lifecycle or a registry unrelated to its declared variation axis; compare the simpler library path | AP-01/AP-03 |

A high-level composition root is allowed to know the components it assembles. A module may
own several operations around one invariant. Real infrastructure-dependent behavior needs
integration tests. These are not defects unless the claimed separation or scenario is lost.

Useful questions: which decision is hidden here; what changes with the next implementation;
what must be read or instantiated to test this responsibility; which knowledge is duplicated;
and what would be deleted if the proposed abstraction disappeared?

### When the subject is a document

**Reconstruct the design.** Build the responsibility and scenario tables before the
mechanism details instead of checking whether the document's own versions look complete.
Material cells you must invent identify unresolved decisions. Where relevant, deepen:

- the **authority map** (slot 3): one row per semantic fact, with owner, revision boundary and
  update path;
- the **invariant table** (slot 3): enforcement point and failure behaviour per invariant. An
  invariant with neither is unresolved under DP-03, whatever the prose claims;
- the **stage table** (slot 5): inputs, observed dependencies, output contract, effects and reuse
  boundary per stage. Undeclared effects fall under DP-18;
- the **absence lattice** (DP-02): for each value that can be missing, which of not supplied /
  not applicable / not computed / unknown / invalid / partial / failed the design distinguishes,
  and which collapse into one representation.

**Sort the load-bearing sentences** to keep claim strength honest:

| Kind | How it reads | What it deserves |
|---|---|---|
| Specification | States what holds, where enforced, what is rejected | Assess directly |
| Intention | A desirable property with no mechanism | Unresolved until a mechanism is named |
| Assumption | Rests on an external system, library or later decision | Unstated assumptions are a DP-22 finding |
| Benefit assertion | Performance, simplicity, extensibility | A hypothesis unless evidence is cited (DP-22) |

**The divergence sentence.** For a core mechanism, the one sentence two implementers would read
differently is often the whole finding: "identity is content-based" (over which canonical form —
DP-04); "invalid input is rejected" (at ingest, at query or at publication — DP-03); "the plan is
cached" (keyed on what, invalidated by what — DP-09); "conversion is lossless" (byte, structural,
semantic or approximate — DP-08).

### When the subject is code

The bar in the second column is what makes a shape reportable. Below it, record the item in the
coverage note as examined and unsettled.

| Shape | What makes it evidence | Gate · principles |
|---|---|---|
| **Second authority** — one fact independently editable in two places (constant and schema, schema and validator, validator and adapter, default and fixture) | Both sites cited, and no derivation, generation step or assertion linking them. Check for a derivation first | G1 · DP-01 |
| **Unguarded boundary** — external input, partial construction or deserialization reaching an operation that assumes an invariant | Entry point, operation, and no rejecting check between them (a warning or opt-in check is advisory). Type-level enforcement counts | G3 · DP-03, DP-08 |
| **Hidden effect** — `validate`, `inspect`, `plan`, `explain` paths that mutate, register, lazily initialize or read clock, environment, filesystem, globals or randomness | The mutation or read, and a caller that reasonably assumes purity | G4 · DP-18 |
| **Silent degradation** — default on absence, catch-alls flattening failure classes, unsupported branches with different semantics, lossy conversions | The branch, what the caller observes in each case, and no declared loss or approximation policy | G2/G7 · DP-02, DP-15 |
| **Incomplete reuse key** — a cache or memo key missing a result-affecting input (policy, provider version, configuration, schema revision, upstream identity) | The key, the omitted dependency, and the change that yields a stale hit. Volatile inputs (timestamps, paths, addresses) in a key are the mirror defect | G6 · DP-09 |
| **Unbacked capability** — the accepted surface (enum, trait, registry, config schema, API) wider than the implementation that handles it | The set difference, with the accepted variant and the fallback cited. A typed `Unsupported` is aligned; a silent semantic fallback is not | G7 · DP-15 |
| **Bespoke generic machinery** — own solver loop, graph traversal, cache, parser, retry framework, derivative routine or hand-rolled built-in | The code, the library or built-in that provides the capability at the pinned version, and no stated reason for building it | G8 · DP-13, DP-14 |
| **Adapter with policy** — a conversion layer holding defaults, selection or domain rules found nowhere else | The rule, and the authority that should own it | G1/G2 · DP-14, DP-01 |

Trace the path that executes — the implementation actually selected, the branch taken under the
real configuration. Where dispatch is dynamic, say which path you traced.

### When the scope computes: reuse, graphs and staged execution

| Shape | What makes it evidence | Gate · principles |
|---|---|---|
| **Second reuse mechanism** — a cache or dependency tracker duplicating one another mechanism already owns | Both mechanisms, and a change one invalidates and the other does not | G1 · DP-09, DP-01 |
| **Handle mistaken for version** — a key on a handle, name or "latest" reference whose contents can change under the same identity | The key, the mutable content, and the edit that leaves the key equal | G6 · DP-09 |
| **Absence untracked** — failed lookups and membership not recorded as dependencies | The lookup, the missing membership dependency, and the addition that stays stale | G6 · DP-09 |
| **Effect inside a memo** — a write, registration or external call inside a body that may be skipped or repeated | The effect and the reuse path that skips or repeats it | G4 · DP-18 |
| **Unsound equality** — reuse on allocation identity, iteration order, loose float tolerance or non-canonical labels | The equality, and two results it equates that a consumer would treat differently | G6 · DP-04, DP-11 |
| **Output filter used as input filter** — a projection built from what the answer should contain | The predicate, the omitted element, and the changed result | G6 · DP-07 |
| **Silent graph reinterpretation** — symmetrized direction, collapsed parallel edges, dropped isolates, a weight read under the wrong meaning | The conversion site and the algorithm requirement it violates | G2 · DP-07 |
| **Index-space or version bridge** — results zipped against another iteration order, implicit compaction, types from two library majors joined by casts | The mapping or its absence, and the two index spaces or versions | G2/G3 · DP-04, DP-15 |
| **Misnamed algorithm** — a routine recorded under the name of an algorithm it does not implement | The entry point, its actual behaviour, and the recorded name | G7 · DP-15 |
| **Heuristic promoted to fact** — communities, rankings or similarity used as dependency, equivalence or execution boundaries | The consuming decision and the missing validation | G2/G7 · DP-07 |
| **Global computation per partition** — a whole-structure analysis run per batch, or a predicate pushed into it | The plan shape and the global result that differs | G6 · DP-08 |
| **Silent truncation** — a limit, iteration cap or sampling returning something indistinguishable from the complete result | The limit, and what the caller sees when it is hit | G5 · DP-12, DP-20 |

For reuse claims, the settling question is always: after the edit that would expose it, would
the incremental result equal a clean recomputation? Answer it by reasoning over the observed
dependencies; a comparison is worth running only where that reasoning leaves real doubt.

### When the subject is both

| Question | Finding shape |
|---|---|
| Do the document's semantics and the implementation's match? | Divergence against the pair; name the authority and the reconciliation (DP-01) |
| Does the document describe a state the code has left? | Stale specification — say whether the document is a target or a record; one that is neither competes with the code |
| Does the code implement semantics the document omits? | Undocumented surface (DP-24) |
| Does the document claim capabilities the code lacks? | G7 — narrow the claim or relabel it *Proposed* |
| Which evidence label does each claim now deserve? | Re-label per principles §D |

## §2 Finding calibration

### Architecture — change amplification without a wrong current output

**Inadequate.** "The runtime module is large; split it into smaller modules."

**Adequate.** "For scenario S02, replacing an existing solver capability requires changing
consumer-side matches on the backend's status enum as well as its adapter. The consumer
therefore owns interpretation of backend mechanics. **Consequence:** every added backend
coordinates result-policy changes in unrelated consumers despite an unchanged domain outcome
contract. **Correction:** make the integration owner translate into the existing semantic
outcome once. **Verification:** trace the replacement through that boundary and exercise the
shared outcome contract where doubt remains. AP-01/AP-02, G9."

### Architecture — test isolation

**Adequate.** "S03 asks to exercise request selection independently. Its constructor takes the
entire application runtime and opens the store, although selection consumes only a capability
set and explicit policy. **Consequence:** the local test requires storage setup and failure
modes unrelated to selection. **Correction:** accept the two required inputs; the composition
root supplies them. A new dependency-injection container is unnecessary. AP-02/AP-06, G9."

### Architecture — a justified abstraction

Two confirmed provider implementations have different state lifecycles but satisfy the same
consumer operation. A narrow capability contract with each provider owning its state serves
that variation. This supports AP-02/AP-06. It does not justify a universal provider registry,
nor does it require wrapping stable shared data types already chosen as a semantic contract.

Adequate and inadequate versions of the same observation. The difference is always the same
three things: a concrete consequence, evidence at the right grain, and citations that do work.

### A — Authority

**Inadequate.** "Violates DP-01: the schema appears in several places. Recommend consolidating."

**Adequate.** "Column nullability for the state-variable table is independently editable at
`catalog/schema.rs:88` and at `ingest/validate.rs:214`, which re-lists required fields as string
literals; neither derives from the other and no test compares them. **Consequence:** making a
field required only in the validator admits nulls the kernels assume absent, panicking at
`solve/assemble.rs:131`. **Correction:** derive the validator's required set from the schema
(~2 call sites). **Verification:** a test asserting the two sets are equal; it fails today.
DP-01, DP-03, G1."

### B — Absence semantics

**Inadequate.** "DP-02 is not fully satisfied; absence states should be clearer."

**Adequate.** "An unsolved variable, a variable outside its domain and a variable whose upstream
computation failed are all null in the result column (§4.3). **Consequence:** a consumer counting
nulls cannot separate a failed solve from a partial one. **Correction:** a typed status beside the
value — one declaration if made before the result contract has consumers. **Verification:** a
negative test asserting the three cases are distinguishable at the result boundary. DP-02, DP-19,
G2."

### C — Over-construction of bespoke machinery

**Inadequate.** Silence, or praise for extensibility.

**Adequate.** "§6 introduces an own provider registry with a capability-negotiation protocol for
one backend. The registry adds a declaration surface and conformance obligations the design does
not fund, and duplicates the selection mechanism the adopted framework already offers.
**Consequence:** the first real second backend needs distinctions the negotiation vocabulary
cannot express, so the registry is rewritten. **Correction:** use the framework's mechanism
behind the existing trait and typed `Unsupported`; remove the own registry. **Verification:** none
needed — this removes machinery. DP-16, DP-13, G8."

### D — Bespoke generic code

**Inadequate.** "Consider using a library here."

**Adequate.** "`solve/newton.rs:40–210` implements a damped Newton iteration with its own line
search for square systems. The adopted nonlinear solver library provides globalized Newton with
scaling and typed failure status at the pinned version; no stated reason explains the bespoke
path. **Consequence:** two convergence behaviours with different failure semantics, and fixes to
one do not reach the other. **Correction:** route square systems through the library; delete the
module and its tests. **Verification:** existing square-system tests pass through the library
path, and the module is gone. DP-13, DP-16, G8."

### E — Evidence labels

**Inadequate.** "The design is validated end to end — see the integration tests."

**Adequate.** "Round trip is *Tested* for the structural case (`tests/roundtrip.rs::schema_roundtrip`,
14 fixtures, exact structural equality) and *Proposed* for metadata, which §3 claims is preserved
but nothing exercises. Narrow the claim or add the metadata case. DP-22, DP-23."

### F — Projection scope

**Adequate.** "The block-analysis projection keeps only equations reachable backwards from the
requested outputs (§4.2), then decomposes cycles on that subgraph. An equation outside the
ancestor set that closes a cycle through two ancestors is dropped. **Consequence:** two coupled
equations are solved sequentially and converge elsewhere or fail, with no diagnostic.
**Correction:** decompose on the enclosing scope, then select every block the ancestors intersect.
**Verification:** a fixture with such a cycle asserting one block of size two; it fails today.
DP-07, DP-12, G6."

## §3 How the slots compress

| 1 Scope/drivers | Boundary, qualities, standard version, evidence limits | Same, briefly |
| 2 Decomposition | Responsibilities, contracts and consequential dependencies | Only affected boundary when material |
| 3 Contracts/authority | Owners and obligations; profile details where applicable | Only touched contracts |
| 4 Scenarios | Representative change paths, including test isolation where relevant | The affected scenario; reuse its definition |
| 5 Mechanisms | Details that settle a material question | Only needed details |
| 6 Assessment/gates | Six foundations and applicable gates, independently | Affected foundations and gates; scope omissions |
| 7 Findings | Concrete architectural or behavioral consequences | Same standard, shorter |
| 8 Library fit | Material adoption/retention choices and ownership costs | Changed integration only |
| 9 Alternatives | Real alternatives, including simplest viable | When a material choice exists |
| 10 Verification | Claim-specific evidence and gaps | Settling evidence, no ritual test expansion |
| 11 Disposition | Link the single status owner and authority routes | Link existing owner |
| 12 Decision | Architecture, behavior, then overall scope/decision | Same distinctions |
