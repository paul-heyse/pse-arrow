The brief you were given is your scope. Implement it end to end: read the files and
contracts it names, inspect the affected producers and consumers before editing, then
build the target directly. Move every caller onto the new mechanism and delete what it
replaces in the same change, including its tests and fixtures. Do not keep a shim, a
compatibility API or a second production path.

Other agents may be editing this checkout. Change only what the brief covers, leave
unrelated lines as they are, and never revert or reformat work that is not yours. When a
file you need is already modified, work with those changes.

Stop and report, rather than deciding, when the brief disagrees with the code, when a
dependency it assumes is missing, or when the change would alter a contract or decision
the brief does not name. Report a discovery outside the brief instead of acting on it.
Do not commit, push or start further agents unless the brief says so.

A new mechanism gets its targeted tests in the same change. Check your work with
`just check-package <pkg>` and `just unit-package <pkg> <filter>`, and run `just codegen`
when a generator or registry declaration changed. Never edit a generated path. Run a
native solver, conformance, parity or linked-Python command through
`bash scripts/memory-cap.sh <command>`. A failing check is a result to report with its
output: do not weaken a test, add a fallback or skip a case to make it pass.

Return the files changed, what was deleted, each command you ran with its result, and
anything left unfinished, unverified or outside the brief.

Read AGENTS.md first and follow its Execution rhythm: compile checks and targeted unit
tests while implementing, immediate deletion of provably replaced code; no formatting,
lint or integration suites until all functional scope in the plan is implemented. Use the repository command surface and pinned tools. Search with rg and
ast-grep; no external code-intelligence service is assumed. Report what changed, what was
deleted and which tests ran; evidence labels and baseline counts belong to plan Outcomes
and qualification reports.

**Skills and library documentation.** Before working in an area a repository skill covers,
load that skill: in Claude, use the Skill tool; in Codex, use `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

| Area | Skills |
|---|---|
| Native solvers | `native-solver-libraries` |
| Symbolica, faer, Oximo, FeOS, POUNCE presolve | `symbolica-faer-oximo` |
| Data, storage and query tracing | `datafusion`, `deltalake`, `datafusion-tracing` |
| Incremental compilation | `salsa` |
| Graphs | `rust-graphs` |
| Symbolic reasoning | `rust-reasoning` |
| Rust code facts; search and rewrite | `rust-code-model`; `ast-grep-ripgrep` |
| IDAES behaviour and parity | `pyomo-and-solvers` |
| Decisions and reviews | `adr`, `design-review`, `design-review-process-simulator` |

For any other library, framework, SDK or tool API (for example sqlx, PostgreSQL, tokio, PyO3,
maturin, bindgen or SCIP's C API), first load the Context7 tools through ToolSearch
(`select:mcp__context7__resolve-library-id,mcp__context7__query-docs`). Then query current
documentation before relying on memory.
