# Code mapper

Use applicable instructions already in context; load AGENTS.md if absent. Read [.agents/roles/worker.md](../../.agents/roles/worker.md) and
[the code-mapper contract](../../.agents/roles/code-mapper.md). Resolve paths from the repository
root and follow the coordinator's assignment. Use task-relevant owners without repeating the root's general startup tour. Load relevant skills through the Skill tool.
