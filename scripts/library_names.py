"""Stage S3 of the library utilization catalog: canonical item paths from the skills' indexes.

Each enabled Rust skill ships `content/index/{symbols,aliases,methods}.tsv`: the defining path
of every public item, the paths it is reachable by (re-exports, facades) and its methods. A
capability's `items` are meant to be defining paths, so this resolves each recorded item against
that union index:

- `canonical`: already a defining path.
- `alias`: a re-export or facade path; rewritten to the defining path.
- `name`: unknown path, but exactly one item in the same crate has that last segment (a crate-root
  re-export such as `arrow_schema::Schema`); rewritten to it.
- `method`: `Type::method`, with `Type` resolved by the rules above and the method listed in
  `methods.tsv`.
- `ambiguous` / `absent`: the crate is indexed but the item is not (or is one of several): the
  skill's index does not list it (a private or fork-patched item, a name from another version).
- `unindexed`: no skill indexes the crate (sqlx, pyo3, ...); left as recorded.

Nothing here needs a build. Resolution is relative to the version each skill indexes, which
`skill_pin_delta` on the library record says when it differs from ours.
