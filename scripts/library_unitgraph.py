"""The compiled dependency graph, from nightly cargo's unit graph.

`cargo build --unit-graph -Zunstable-options` prints every unit cargo would build (library,
build script, test, bench, example; every profile) with the features it resolved and the units it
depends on. It computes from Cargo.lock and the manifests: no build, no target directory, about
0.3 s here, and it works on a tree that does not compile. That makes it the source for two facts a
manifest-only read gets wrong once a workspace-hack crate unifies features: the features a package
is *compiled* with, and which workspace crates actually link it.

Ids look like `registry+https://...#name@1.2.3`, `git+https://...?rev=..#name@1.2.3` and
`path+file:///.../crates/x#0.1.0` (the last carries no name; it is the directory).
