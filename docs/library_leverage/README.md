# Library leverage

**Implemented guidance.** A codebase-first workflow with three distinct
repository skills and evergreen assessment collections. Benefits to discovery and design quality
remain Proposed; installation does not establish an assessed codebase or qualified library fit.

Start with the [framework](library-leverage-framework.md) for responsibilities, handoffs, collection
paths and retention. Read the [base opportunity patterns](patterns.md) with additional patterns
from `assessment-patterns.md` when that output exists. All stages use relevant additions on the
same footing; promotion into base guidance is a manual operator decision.

| Skill | Question it answers | Collection it maintains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [leverage-codebase-audit](https://github.com/paul-heyse/pse-arrow/blob/main/.codex/skills/leverage-codebase-audit/SKILL.md) | Which concrete responsibilities and operations deserve investigation? | [Codebase opportunities](codebase/README.md) |
| [leverage-library-assessment](https://github.com/paul-heyse/pse-arrow/blob/main/.codex/skills/leverage-library-assessment/SKILL.md) | Which focused library capabilities could address those opportunities, under what conditions? | [Library assessments](libraries/README.md) |
| [leverage-opportunity-review](https://github.com/paul-heyse/pse-arrow/blob/main/.codex/skills/leverage-opportunity-review/SKILL.md) | Which complete option best addresses each opportunity, and why? | [Comparative reviews](reviews/README.md) |

## Use the workflow

Invoke the relevant skill with the intended scope, for example:

- `$leverage-codebase-audit` — identify library-leverage opportunities in a selected operation,
  subsystem or the codebase.
- `$leverage-library-assessment` — assess selected opportunities against relevant capabilities,
  using the opportunity IDs and existing library analysis.
- `$leverage-opportunity-review` — compare complete options for those opportunities and recommend
  bounded target designs.

An end-to-end request can authorize all three stages. Coordinate their substantive handoffs and
iterate where new evidence changes a premise. A focused inquiry needs only the relevant scope;
ordinary implementation and API questions do not initiate this workflow.

## Current accounts

No opportunity audit, library applicability assessment or comparative review has been run by
installing the workflow. The three collection folders and their README entry points exist and
explicitly identify their unassessed state. Author topic documents and record inspected baselines
when the first real assessment supplies content. Create `assessment-patterns.md` with its first useful
addition; do not invent patterns to populate a scaffold. Record inspected baselines and limits
rather than treating empty collections as assessed.

The shared [vocabulary](references/shared-language.md) and
[collection-writing guidance](references/collection-writing.md) support all three skills. Keep
reusable library types and useful additional patterns when their originating matches retire.
The library collection is distinct from the broad [capability overviews](../libraries/README.md):
its research starts with codebase opportunities and accumulates focused capability knowledge.

The tracked skill source is `.codex/skills`. Existing `.agents/skills` and `.claude/skills`
aliases expose the same sources to Codex and Claude Code. These three local process skills are
tracked through the existing allowlist; `.config/library-skills.toml` continues to select only
the shared native-solver-libraries capability skill. Existing formal review, planning and
implementation routes retain their scope and authority under the
[framework binding](library-leverage-framework.md#repository-binding-and-downstream-use).
